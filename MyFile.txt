The sky was a deep shade of blue as the sun began to set. 
Birds chirped in the distance and the leaves rustled in the gentle breeze. 
A rabbit hopped across the field, its white tail bobbing up and down. 
In the distance, a deer grazed on the lush grass. 
The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers. 
It was a peaceful and serene scene.
